# J&D Report With CI/CD in Power BI

## 🚀 Power BI CI/CD Architecture 

- **Validation Pipeline**  
  Automatically runs on each commit to the dev branch. Checks that datasets and reports follow best practices, verifies measure accuracy, and applies a wide range of validation rules (such as reviewing data model relationships or flagging report pages with too many visuals). Ensures all requirements are met before allowing pull requests to the main branch.

- **Release Pipeline**  
  Automatically deploys changes that pass validation to different deployment stages. Each stage has its own workspace, reducing the risk of unintended changes and supporting robust testing before production rollout.

- **Approval Process**  
  Release managers review and approve deployments to production, providing human oversight and compliance before changes go live.
